# Develop Locally, Use Images from Production

If you are a WordPress Developer, you might need this plugin which rewrite your local image url by your production website.

You might not even want to deal with images. Perhaps:

You don’t want the images in your repo. Maybe the repo is just a theme folder and it makes sense to leave it that way.
You have like 10 GB worth of images and it’s impractical and unnecessary to move them around.

I think that’s totally legit. A publication-style site probably doesn’t need every single image they’ve ever uploaded as part of their main repo.
